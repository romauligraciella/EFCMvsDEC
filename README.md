# Which Clusters Better? ðŸ§  Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC) vs EFCM

## Project summary
This project compares two clustering approaches, EFCM (Enhanced Fuzzy C-Means) and DEC (Deep Embedded Clustering), for unsupervised topic discovery in user-generated text.
The goal is to evaluate which method produces more coherent topics when applied to review data embedded using BERT. 
DEC, which combines deep learning and clustering in a unified framework, is expected to outperform traditional fuzzy methods due to its ability to learn meaningful feature representations.

## Outcome summary

The experiment tested topic coherence across 1â€“10 clusters using TC-W2V (Topic Coherence with Word2Vec). 
DEC consistently outperformed EFCM, peaking at 0.23428 with 4 clusters.

DEC produced tighter, more clearly separated clusters, thanks to its built-in parameter optimization during training. 
EFCM showed more overlapping clusters, as it lacks a parameter optimization phase, leading to less distinct topic boundaries.
While EFCM was competitive at some points, its coherence scores were less stable across different topic numbers.

## Recommendation
DEC-based clustering model can be integrated into intelligent dashboards for businesses to extract trending topics from user reviews, enabling faster, data-driven decision-making.
